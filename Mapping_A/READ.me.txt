Potentials for FM and IBI models for mapping A can be find in the respective folders.

*CG1-CG1.pot* : corresponds to the non-bonded potential between superatoms 1-1
*bond.pot*: corresponds to the 1-1 bonds potential
IBI: *angle.pot*: corresponds to the 1-1-1 angle potential. // FM: there are two potential for angles, namely *angle1.pot* and *angle2.pot*, which act, respectively, in the angles belonging to the first and second peak of the angle distribution function (see the main manuscript + supplementary material for more information).
