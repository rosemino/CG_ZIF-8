For the FM model, the coefficients of the volume dependent term used in the pressure correction are:
psi_1: -1992662.038339588 atm*(angs^3)
psi_2: 3921361.3957168837 atm*(angs^3)
psi_3: -32493843.97254567 atm*(angs^3)
Reminding that this is a parametrization against an atomistic benchmark simulation that has an average volume of 4878.87 angs^3 (corresponding to 16.96 angs) at 300K, 1 atm.
